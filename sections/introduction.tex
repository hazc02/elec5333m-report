\section{Introduction}

This report presents the work carried out across five simulation-based
laboratories using Keysight ADS, each examining a different subsystem within a wireless
communication link. Together, these studies explore how theoretical concepts 
introduced in the module appear in practical design scenarios, and how subsystem 
behaviour influences overall system performance.

The laboratories cover core RF functions including link budgeting, amplifier
linearity, filtering, transistor operation and antenna radiation. For each
task, simulations are used not only to obtain quantitative results but to
interpret them in the context of the underlying theory. This approach allows
the accuracy and limitations of the models to be assessed, and highlights how
design choices at one stage can constrain or improve the behaviour of the
complete link.

The purpose of the report is therefore twofold: to document the simulation
methods and key findings from each laboratory, and to form a coherent view of
how these individual results connect to broader wireless system design. The
following sections outline the methodology, present and discuss the main
results, and reflect on the implications for real RF subsystem design.
