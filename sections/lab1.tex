% Lab 1 content: Link Budget and Propagation

\section{Link Budget and Propagation (Lab 1)}
\label{sec:lab1}

This laboratory applies link-budget equations to predict received power from
transmit power, antenna gains and propagation loss, then validates the
predictions in ADS. The results highlight how frequency, distance and additional
attenuation terms shape link performance and motivate the later labs.

The theoretical background draws on the Friis transmission relationship and the
free--space path loss model, which describe how power decays with distance and
frequency. Received power is obtained by combining transmitter power, antenna
gains and propagation loss in decibel form. Antenna directivity is central,
with higher frequency systems relying on significant antenna gain to counter
increased path loss. Free--space propagation assumes an unobstructed
line--of--sight link, providing a controlled baseline for analysis. ADS then
allows this ideal behaviour to be compared against scenarios that include
additional losses such as atmospheric absorption or building penetration.

Before validating the system performance using ADS, each scenario was first
evaluated using the link-budget equations provided in the Lab~1
handbook~\cite{Lab1_handbook}. The received power is obtained using:
\[
P_r(dBm) = P_t(dBm) + G_t(dBi) + G_r(dBi)
           + 20\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi R}\right),
\]
with antenna gains and parabolic reflector diameters calculated using:

\[
G_x(dBi) = 10\log_{10}\!\left(
\eta\frac{\pi^2 d^2}{\lambda^2}
\right).
\]
These expressions provide a baseline prediction for each wireless link prior to
introducing simulation tools or additional channel impairments.

\subsection*{Exercise A: 700\,MHz Terrestrial Broadcast Link}
For a carrier frequency of $700$\,MHz, the wavelength is:
\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3\times10^8}{700\times10^6} = 0.43\;\mathrm{m}.
\]
The transmit power of $5$\,kW corresponds to
\[
P_t = 10\log_{10}(5\times10^6) = 66.99\;\mathrm{dBm}.
\]
The free-space loss over $25$\,km is
\[
\mathrm{FSPL}
= 20\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{0.43}{4\pi\cdot25\times10^3}\right)
= -117.30\;\mathrm{dB}.
\]
The received power is therefore
\[
P_r = 66.99 + 3 + 10 - 117.30
    = -37.31\;\mathrm{dBm}.
\]

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Exercise B: 38\,GHz Backbone Link}

In this exercise, the objective is to determine the diameter of the transmit
parabolic antenna required to achieve a received power of $-50$\,dBm. The
carrier frequency is $38$\,GHz, giving a wavelength of
\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f} =  \frac{3\times 10^8}{38\times10^9}
        = 7.89\times 10^{-3}\;\mathrm{m}.
\]

The receiver uses a $15$\,cm dish with efficiency $\eta = 0.55$. Its gain is
\[
G_r
= 10\log_{10}\!\left(
\eta\frac{\pi^2 d_r^2}{\lambda^2}
\right)
= 10\log_{10}\!\left(
0.55\frac{\pi^2 (0.15)^2}{(7.89\times10^{-3})^2}
\right)
= 32.92\;\mathrm{dBi}.
\]

The free--space loss over $R = 10$\,km is
\[
\mathrm{FSPL}
= 20\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi R}\right)
= -144.04\;\mathrm{dB}.
\]

Atmospheric absorption adds a further $10$\,dB attenuation. The system transmit
power is $100$\,mW, corresponding to
\[
P_t = 10\log_{10}(100) = 20\;\mathrm{dBm}.
\]

The link budget expression becomes
\[
P_r = P_t + G_t + G_r + \mathrm{FSPL} - 10.
\]

Setting the target received power $P_r = -50$\,dBm and solving for $G_t$ gives
\[
-50
= 20 + G_t + 32.92 - 144.04 - 10,
\]
\[
-50 = -101.12 + G_t,
\]
\[
G_t = 51.12\;\mathrm{dBi}.
\]

The corresponding transmit-antenna diameter follows from the parabolic reflector
gain expression:
\[
G_t = 10\log_{10}\!\left(
\eta\frac{\pi^2 d_t^2}{\lambda^2}
\right),
\]
\[
d_t
= \lambda
  \sqrt{
  \frac{10^{G_t/10}}{\eta\pi^2}
  }.
\]

Substituting $\eta = 0.55$, $\lambda = 7.89\times10^{-3}$\,m and
$G_t = 51.12$\,dBi,
\[
d_t
= 7.89\times10^{-3}
  \sqrt{
  \frac{10^{5.112}}{0.55\pi^2}
  }
  = 1.22\;\mathrm{m}.
\]

Thus, a transmit-antenna diameter of approximately \textbf{1.22\,m} is required
to achieve a received power of $-50$\,dBm under the stated conditions.

\end{figure}

Atmospheric attenuation varies with frequency due to absorption by oxygen and
water vapour, producing alternating low–loss transmission windows and high–loss
absorption bands (see Fig.~\ref{fig:atmospheric_attenuation}). The 38\,GHz
region falls within a relatively favourable window, whereas frequencies near
22\,GHz and 60\,GHz exhibit significantly greater loss. \cite{millimetre_microwave} The $10$\,dB attenuation
term used in this exercise therefore represents a single point on a broader
frequency–dependent profile and illustrates the importance of accounting for
atmospheric absorption in long–distance link design.

\end{figure}


\subsection*{Exercise C: 1.8\,GHz Cellular Link}
In exercise C, further attenuation factors such as fading margin and building
penetration loss are considered within the link budget. For a $1.8$\,GHz carrier:
\[
\lambda = \frac{3\times10^8}{1.8\times10^9}
        = 0.167\;\mathrm{m}.
\]

The transmitter radiates $100$\,W, corresponding to
\[
P_t = 10\log_{10}(100\,\mathrm{W}/1\,\mathrm{mW})
    = 10\log_{10}(10^5)
    = 50\;\mathrm{dBm}.
\]

The free--space path loss over a $5$\,km link is
\[
\mathrm{FSPL}
= 20\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi R}\right)
= 20\log_{10}\!\left(
\frac{0.167}{4\pi \cdot 5000}
\right)
= -111.53\;\mathrm{dB}.
\]

The transmitter antenna gain is $G_t = 6$\,dB and the receiver antenna gain is
$G_r = 0$\,dB. Fading margin ($20$\,dB) and building penetration loss ($6$\,dB)
combine to give a total additional attenuation of
\[
L_{\mathrm{extra}} = 20 + 6 = 26\;\mathrm{dB}.
\]

The received power is therefore
\[
P_r = P_t + G_t + G_r + \mathrm{FSPL} - L_{\mathrm{extra}},
\]
\[
P_r = 50 + 6 + 0 - 111.53 - 26,
\]
\[
P_r = -81.53\;\mathrm{dBm}.
\]

  simulated value of $P_r = -81.53$\,dBm matches the analytic calculation.}

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Exercise D: Satellite TV Downlink}
The received IF power for a satellite TV system is calculated using the link
parameters provided. The transmit frequency is $12$\,GHz, giving a wavelength
\[
\lambda = \frac{3\times10^8}{12\times10^9}
        = 0.025\;\mathrm{m}.
\]

The spacecraft radiates $100$\,W, corresponding to a transmit power
\[
P_t = 10\log_{10}(100\,\mathrm{W}/1\,\mathrm{mW})
    = 50\;\mathrm{dBm}.
\]

Both transmit and receive antennas have an efficiency of $\eta = 0.6$. The
transmit antenna diameter is $d_t = 2$\,m, giving
\[
G_t
= 10\log_{10}\!\left(
\eta\frac{\pi^2 d_t^2}{\lambda^2}
\right)
= 10\log_{10}\!\left(
0.6\frac{\pi^2 (2)^2}{(0.025)^2}
\right)
= 45.79\;\mathrm{dBi}.
\]

The receive antenna diameter is $d_r = 0.6$\,m:
\[
G_r
= 10\log_{10}\!\left(
0.6\frac{\pi^2 (0.6)^2}{(0.025)^2}
\right)
= 35.33\;\mathrm{dBi}.
\]

The free--space path loss (FSPL) for a geostationary satellite at
$40\,000$\,km is
\[
\mathrm{FSPL}
= 20\log_{10}\!\left(
\frac{\lambda}{4\pi R}
\right)
= 20\log_{10}\!\left(
\frac{0.025}{4\pi\cdot40\,000\times10^3}
\right)
= -206.10\;\mathrm{dB}.
\]

Atmospheric absorption produces a further $2$\,dB attenuation. After the receive
antenna, the signal is amplified by a low-noise amplifier (LNA) with $30$\,dB
gain and downconverted in a mixer with a $10$\,dB conversion loss.

The total received IF power is therefore
\[
P_{\mathrm{IF}}
= P_t + G_t + G_r + \mathrm{FSPL}
  - 2\;\mathrm{dB}
  + 30\;\mathrm{dB}
  - 10\;\mathrm{dB},
\]
\[
P_{\mathrm{IF}}
= 50 + 45.79 + 35.33 - 206.10 - 2 + 30 - 10,
\]
\[
P_{\mathrm{IF}}
= -56.98\;\mathrm{dBm}.
\]
