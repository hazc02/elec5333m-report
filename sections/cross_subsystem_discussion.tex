\label{sec:cross_subsystem_discussion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How link budget results define required amplifier gain and noise margin.
  \item How amplifier linearity and filter behaviour interact in a real chain.
  \item How device-level characteristics feed into system-level performance.
  \item Limitations of the simulations (ideal models, omitted noise sources, parasitics, EM simplifications).
\end{itemize}
